While you're standing in line for a ride, you and your friends decide to play a game where you all tell a story, by each saying one word at a time in turn.

Practice adding together strings by writing six separate words, each wrapped in their own set of quotations, and using the plus sign to concatenate the strings.

Put the code you've written to do this in the provided `code.rb` file.

Use the "puts" command at the beginning of your line of code to print your results to the terminal. As a reminder, you can run this code with `ruby code.rb`!
