## Instructions

In this challenge, we will be defining classes for both a Circle and a Square. We will be using prewritten Jasmine tests for the Circle Class, but you will have to write both the tests and code for the Square Class.

### Getting Set Up

```no-highlight
$ et get geometric-classes-js
$ cd geometric-classes-js
$ bundle
$ ruby app.rb
```

Open the following link in the browser <http://localhost:4567/js-specs.html>.

You will see a a few failing tests indicated by red x's and a few pending tests indicated by yellow circles. Your first task should be to venture into `public/js/Circle.js` to define the Circle Class in JavaScript.

### Writing Tests

Once you have gotten all the CircleSpec tests to pass, look into the `public/js/spec/SquareSpec.js` file. Here you will write the tests for the methods described. Once you have finished writing out the tests, go to the `public/js/Square.js` file to write the code in order to pass the recently created test suite.

You should see all green circles in your test suite once you have completed the assignment.

### Extra Challenge

If you have finished this assignment early, feel free to go back to the E-Commerce exercise and implement JavaScript tests for that application using Jasmine. Look to this assignment, previous readings, or Jasmine documentation for test suite set up.
