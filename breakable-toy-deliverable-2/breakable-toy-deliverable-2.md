By this point, you should have met with your mentor to solidify your Breakable Toy idea. Amongst other things, you should have established what your starting point will be in tackling the app - what your first model will be, and what the first couple features involving that model will be. If you feel unsure about this, reach out to your mentor, since you'll need that plan for this next step!

## What to submit

### ER Diagrams

Please submit two ER diagrams:

- One diagram that represents the future state of your database after you finish your very first couple features. This should only be *one or two models*.
- One diagram that represents a more complete view of where you would like your models/database to go. This can include most/all of the models you plan on (reasonably) including your app in the next two weeks. (It is okay if this changes as you go, we just want to get a sense of where you are going in the longer term.)

Make sure to clearly name these ER diagrams so we can easily tell them apart.

### User Stories and Acceptance Criteria

For each of your very first features that you plan on working on, write out a set of user stories and acceptance criteria. Remember that even though you might be thinking of something as one big "feature" (i.e. "I want to let people post songs on my site"), it can probably be broken down into smaller features. (I.e., "Users can view a list of songs", "User can add a new song", "User can delete a song they added", "User can edit a song submission they made".) Each of those smaller features should have its own set of acceptance criteria.

Identify at least one of these smaller features to be implemented using React.js, (e.g. "Users can view a list of songs that live-updates"), and make a note of this intention.

### Brief Description (aka Your "Elevator Pitch")


Finally, **please also attach a short description of your Breakable Toy.** This assignment may very well be graded by someone who is not your mentor, so please make sure to include all the information necessary to make it readable by someone with no prior context on your app.

## How to submit

For your ER diagrams, please submit image files. (I.e., if you made a diagram on Draw.io, take a screenshot!). You can submit your user stories, acceptance criteria and description in any text format you'd like. Markdown, .txt, .doc files, or even links to Google Docs are all fine!

Please, submit this by the end of Week 7.
