### Introduction

We're on a mission to update our JavaScript codebase to the latest ES6 standard.
You are tasked with refactoring the provided code.


### Getting Started

Open up the terminal and use the following instructions to get started.

```no-highlight
$ cd ~/challenges       # for Mac/Linux
$ cd %HOME%/challenges  # for Windows
$ et get refactor-reverse-string-function
```

Open the `refactor-reverse-string-function` project folder in your editor.

Open the `refactor-reverse-string-function/index.html` file in your browser.

In the browser, open up the JavaScript console. You will be saving your
code in `main.js`. Then, you can refresh the page in order to see your changes.


### Problem Statement

The code in `main.js` is written using the old ES5 JavaScript syntax. Bring it
into the current decade by refactoring the code to use ES6 syntax.

{% show_hint %}
* Replace any `var` statements with `let` statements.
* Use **arrow functions** instead of the `function` keyword.
* Replace any string concatenation with string interpolation using **template literals**.
* Use **iteration** with the `.forEach` method, instead of a `for` loop.
{% endshow_hint %}

### Submitting Your Code

Once you have completed this exercise, use the `et` command to submit your code
from this project's folder.

```no-highlight
$ cd ~/challenges/refactor-reverse-string-function       # for Mac/Linux
$ cd %HOME%/challenges/refactor-reverse-string-function  # for Windows
$ et submit
```
