### Introduction

In this exercise, we will get some practice writing a class from scratch.

### Define the Constructor

Define a new `class` that represents a `Rectangle` in `rectangle.js`.

A `Rectangle` should require two arguments, the `width` and the `height`.
This information should be retained as part of each object's **state**, also
known as **attributes**.

You should be able to replicate output similar to the following JavaScript
console session using the class you have created.

```no-highlight
> new Rectangle(5, 6);
< ▶ Rectangle {width: 5, height: 6}
> new Rectangle(4, 6);
< ▶ Rectangle {width: 4, height: 6}
> new Rectangle(4, 8);
< ▶ Rectangle {width: 4, height: 8}
```

{% show_solution %}
```no-highlight
class Rectangle {
  constructor(width, height) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
  }
}
```
{% endshow_solution %}

### Allow Square Rectangles

Modify your `Rectangle` class so that it only requires a single argument, but
allows an optional, second argument.

If a single argument is specified, assume the `Rectangle` is a square, where
both the `width` and `height` are equal.

```no-highlight
> new Rectangle(5, 6)
< ▶ Rectangle {width: 5, height: 6}
> new Rectangle(8, 6)
< ▶ Rectangle {width: 8, height: 6}
> new Rectangle(9)
< ▶ Rectangle {width: 9, height: 9}
> new Rectangle(12)
< ▶ Rectangle {width: 12, height: 12}
```

{% show_solution %}
```no-highlight
class Rectangle {
  constructor(width, height) {
    this.width = width;

    if (!!height) {
      this.height = height;
    } else {
      this.height = width;
    }
  }
}
```
{% endshow_solution %}

### Give the Rectangle Behavior

Add a method to your `Rectangle` class that calculates the area of a `Rectangle`
object, based on its width and height.

```no-highlight
> let rectangle = new Rectangle(5, 6);
> rectangle.area();
< 30
> let anotherRectangle = new Rectangle(9);
> anotherRectangle.area;
< 81
```

{% show_hint %}
* The area of rectangle is defined as its `width` multiplied by its `height`
* You will need to create a method in order to calculate and return the area of
  the Rectangle object.
{% endshow_hint %}

{% show_solution %}
```no-highlight
class Rectangle {
  constructor(width, height) {
    this.width = width;

    if (!!height) {
      this.height = height;
    } else {
      this.height = width;
    }
  }

  area() {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }
}
```
{% endshow_solution %}
