## Before You Begin

Run `et get price_of_admission` to download this exercise in your `challenges` folder. If you need a refresher or you don't yet have `et` working, look for the "How to Use ET" article in your Curriculum.

## The Exercise
It's a beautiful summer day. You and some friends are on your way to an
amusement park! There are four (4) adults and two (2) children in your group.

Admission prices are marked on the sign:

```no-highlight
---------------------
| ADULTS: $12.80    |
| CHILDREN: $4.00   |
---------------------
```

Write a line of code in the provided `code.rb` file that calculates the total cost to get all six of you into the park.

### Bonus:

To calculate how much each adult should pay, write a line of code that
both calculates the above sum and then splits it evenly between the
four adults. Include this code in your `code.rb` file!

## Before You Move On
Submit the code you wrote! Run `et submit` from the `price_of_admission` directory. The `et` gem will grab the whole folder and upload it to Horizon.
You'll do this a lot, so if you're having trouble with `et`, please put a question in the Question Queue or reach for help from other students or staff on Slack.
